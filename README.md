You touched my heart on a summer's night.

And we walk through our silly fights also funny days.

Now I just pray and say...

Give you my whole love that never fades away.


You are my super special.

A princess living in my castle of memory.

Now I just pray and say...

God bless my dear friend embrace happiness every day.


Happy birthday
